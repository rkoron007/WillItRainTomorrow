## Overview 

This simple fun app uses MetaWather's API to find the user's input city and determine if it'll rain tomorrow. In my 
previous life as a dog walker the question "Will it rain tomorrow?" was always on the tip of my tongue when preparing for 
the next day. Rain always means preparation is necessary!
